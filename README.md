Welcome to DISCORDIA, user!

DISCORDIA is a discord bot that can read and write text messages,
store them on a contextual memory, and may use multimodal vision
models to answer with messages that holds image attachments and
can do a function calling to search the internet to fact-check
things. It have the potential to also do other kinds of function
calling. Explore the example of the web search and be creative about it.

Warning: Before proceeding, note that this is a discord SELFBOT,
a method that fetches directly the discord APIs without using the
discord official libs. This is against the discord TOS, and could
get you banned. Make sure to use this on a spare discord account,
and keep an eye on the time sleeps you use to call these apis.

For this bot to work you will need to change its configurations:

- Get your discord access token in the site by:
  1. On inspect element, go to the network tab;
  2. Click on the "messages" request;
  3. Grab the authorization token;
- Define your keys for the services in use:
  1. Groq for ultra fast LLM text generation (Llama3 70B);
  2. Google Gemini for multimodal image processing;
  3. Jina for powering the LLM with a search engine
- Define the personality of your bot by changing the "(...)"
  parts (or everything else) to your own bot specs for your system prompts;

Have fun ::)
